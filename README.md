# Questions Package

This Go package, named `questions`, provides functionality for handling various questions related to string manipulation and recursion.

## Functions

### 1. SortWords

```go
// SortWords sorts a slice of strings in descending order based on the number of occurrences of the letter 'A' in each word.
// If two words have the same number of 'A' occurrences, the longer word comes first.
// The input slice is modified in-place and also returned.
func SortWords(words []string) []string

// RecursiveFunction is a recursive function that takes an integer n as input and prints the value of n.
// It recursively calls itself with n divided by 2 until n is greater than 1.
func RecursiveFunction(n int)

// MostRepeated returns the most repeated string in the given slice of strings.
// It counts the occurrences of each string and returns the one with the highest count.
func MostRepeated(data []string) string
